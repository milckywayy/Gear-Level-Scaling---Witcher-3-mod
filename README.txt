=============================== INSTALLATION ===============================


1. Extract mod and copy "bin" and "mods" into game's main directory: "<game_path>\The Witcher 3\".

You should get:
"<game_path>\The Witcher 3\mods\modGearLevelScaling"
"<game_path>\The Witcher 3\bin\config\r4game\user_config_matrix\pc\modGearLevelScaling.xml"


2. Go to "<game_path>\The Witcher 3\bin\config\r4game\user_config_matrix\pc\" and open "dx12filelist.txt" or "dx11filelist.txt" (depends on your configuration). Then add new line "modGearLevelScaling.xml;" at the end of the file.


3. If you have compatibility issues, use Script Merger.
